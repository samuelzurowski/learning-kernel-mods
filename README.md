# learning-kernel-mods

This is a repo to essentially learn how kernel programming works. This includes rootkits, looking at various other types of structures and more. Thanks to [https://github.com/xcellerator/linux_kernel_hacking](https://github.com/xcellerator/linux_kernel_hacking) for the awesome resources to learn about this interesting stuff.
